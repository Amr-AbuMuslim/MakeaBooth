      {
        q: "How long does it take to assemble a Transformers booth?",
        a: "Most booths can be set up in 3-4 hours with our standard tools and experienced team. The modular design eliminates complex assembly processes and reduces labor costs significantly.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do I need special tools or training to set up the booth?",

  {
    category: "Customization & Design",
    questions: [
      {
